 Hello guys!

This is the repository for the Assignment 1 of the 
HPC course at DTU 2015-January

I hope we can figure out how to use it... remember
 to make a branch everytime you're in doubt and we'll 
check it and merge it once we've solved it.

PLEASE! 
- Put specific comments to the commits so everyone else
knows what's up. 
- Commit in a branch with your name, not was master, so 
we can keep track of changes.


Good luck, godspeed, live long and prosper
